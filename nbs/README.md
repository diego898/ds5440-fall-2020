# Jupyter Notebooks

Here are some helpful jupyter notebooks. You can run all of these in Colab. 

* NN-Walkthrough: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/diego898/ds5440-fall-2020/blob/master/nbs/NN-Walkthrough.ipynb)
	* This is still a work-in-progress notebook, and is subject to change

* Optimization-Walkthrough: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/diego898/ds5440-fall-2020/blob/master/nbs/Optimization-Walkthrough.ipynb)
	* This is still a work-in-progress notebook, and is subject to change


* Linear transformation example: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/diego898/ds5440-fall-2020/blob/master/nbs/Linear-Transformations-Walkthrough.ipynb)
	* This one is just code that I used to explain in class. I might go back and expand it later.
